# Welcome to Bowtie

Bowtie is an icon font for Visual Studio Online. You can [preview the latest version of Bowtie on CodePen](http://codepen.io/jimlamb/full/epVOBK/). The source SVG images were created using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), an excellent open-source vector graphics editor.

The icons are designed on a 14 unit high grid expressed as a 448 x 448 pixel grid (32 pixels per unit). The width of each icon is an even number of those same units (typically 10, 12, 14, or 16 units).
