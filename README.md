# Welcome to Bowtie

Bowtie is an icon font for Visual Studio Online. You can [preview the latest version of Bowtie on CodePen](http://codepen.io/jimlamb/full/epVOBK/). The source SVG images were created using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), an excellent open-source vector graphics editor.

The icons are designed on a 14 unit high grid expressed as a 448 x 448 pixel grid (32 pixels per unit). The width of each icon is an even number of those same units (typically 10, 12, 14, or 16 units).

## Getting started

Open *demo.html* to see a list of all the glyphs with their codes/ligatures.

To use the generated font in desktop programs, you can install the TTF font. In order to copy the character associated with each icon, refer to the text box at the bottom right corner of each glyph in demo.html. The character inside this text box may be invisible; but it can still be copied. See this guide for more info: https://icomoon.io/#docs/local-fonts

You won't need any of the files located under the *demo-files* directory when including the generated font in your own projects.
